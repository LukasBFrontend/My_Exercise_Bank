# My Exercise Bank

This project uses a template to ease development of Vue 3 in Vite. It is meant to serve as a mock application.
Script, components and css can all be found within `/src`

## Background

I love working out and writing my own exercise programs*. Not much unlike coding, there are a variety of variables to play around with and finetune which will predictably change the outcome.
One particulary important variable when it comes to improving sport performance is exercise choice.

For the novice trainee wanting to create their own program, trying to find appropriate exercises can be like navigating a dense jungle. The sheer multitude of available paths is so great that it's impossible
to make a sound choice without some form of guidance. As such my application aims to provide a well organized and easy to grasp layout which will provide the user with easy access to a library of different exercises.

*_An exercise program is a plan and/or schedule detailing what exercises are to be done what days, with what intensity etc._
